Finding Freedom and Achieving Financial Independence
----------------------------------------------------

**Do you crave freedom?** Have you ever dreamed of living a simple life, with no demands on your time except those you choose?

**Freedom beckons!**

In this book, you will discover how the average American can achieve financial independence in just over ten years, from someone who retired in his early 30's. You will learn about career development, investing, and frugality---the three keys to financial independence, as well as how to keep records and track your progress toward financial independence.

This book will make you think about what freedom really means for you, the trade-offs you're making in life that might be holding you back, and how to help others find freedom as well.

Marshall Mason retired at 32 years old, just over seven years after graduating from college. His determination to find freedom started from a brush with poverty after his parents kicked him out.
