\chapter{Note to the reader}
This book was not written with the intention of subsidizing my own financial independence. My only goal in writing this book is to further the cause of freedom and help people find more freedom in their lives. Therefore, all net proceeds from this book will be donated to \textbf{Oxfam} and \textbf{Amnesty International}.

I also want the book itself to be as free as possible. I don't expect readers to spend money for a book that urges them to spend less money. Aside from the obvious contradiction, this also limits its readership to those with money to spare, when the whole point is to maximize freedom for all. I also want its readers to do with it as they feel inspired to do, to modify it, redistribute it, or share it with friends. Therefore, it is licensed under \textbf{Creative Commons} and available as a free download at \textbf{www.freedombeckons.com}.
